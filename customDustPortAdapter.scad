/*
    This file generates an adapter that allows a miter saw dust port to be connected with a shop-vac.  It was specifically designed for the Ryobi 12‚Äù Sliding Compound Miter Saw with Laser TSS120L and the Shop-Vac 90M300.  It may work with other saws and shop-vacs.  The dimensions listed below can be modified for use with another miter saw/shop-vac combo.  Due to the variance in printer calibration and quality, some tweaking of the parameters and/or the print may be required to be able to print the item.
